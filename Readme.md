# Examples for the improved use of infinite lazy lists in functional programming
This repository contains examples for a short talk about the improved use of infinite lazy lists in the computer science class at GSG LÃ¶bau.\
It shows 3 example lists (the sequence of natural numbers, the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) and a function for generating arbitrary
 [arithmetic sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression), whose implementations are provided for an obvious (intuituive) to another more unintuitive, but sometimes more improved way.\
Each implementation is availiable in the language [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29), as well as in the language [Racket/Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_%28programming_language%29).

## About intuitive and unintuitive ways
Many of us start programming with imperiative languages, in which [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) (and thereby the use of "infinite" datastructures) isn't a big deal.
 Even many introductions to functional programming and lazy evaluation don't cover all the possibilities and ways of utilization brought by this feature.\
The talk and these examples show a specific but broadly applicable part of all these features: Self referencing list definitions. By those many list definitions can be improved in terms of code length and readability.
